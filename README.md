# NHS BSA Designer Interview (Technical Test)

As part of your interview, we'd like to get a feel on your range of technical skills.

## NHS.UK Prototype Kit

Within the NHS, we do a lot of prototyping of our ideas. This is to discuss ideas more clearly amongst the team and to test our ideas with real people.

Prototyping reduces risk, development and maintenance costs by testing our assumptions and ideas early and often.

The NHS.UK Prototype Kit helps us by providing a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look and feel like pages on NHS.UK. To do this, the kit uses a range of HTML, SASS (which is used to generate CSS) and JavaScript.

## Scenario 1

You join a high profile NHS BSA agile project that is at the Private Beta stage.

Your new service has a simple user journey which collects a persons name, address and date of birth and allows them to apply to be a magician:

The prototype has a number of issues:

1. It doesnâ€™t use consistent, accessible patterns from the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system">NHS Design System</a>.
2. The prototype doesn't go from the address page to the date of birth page.

Your job is to identify what elements of the prototype are off pattern, and what is stopping the prototype from working, and make the relevant changes.
