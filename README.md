# NHS BSA Interview (Technical Test)

As part of your interview, we'd like to get a feel on your range of technical skills.

## NHS.UK Prototype Kit

Within the NHS, we do a lot of prototyping of our ideas. This is to discuss ideas more clearly amongst the team and to test our ideas with real people.

Prototyping reduces risk, development and maintenance costs by testing our assumptions and ideas early and often.

The NHS.UK Prototype Kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look and feel like pages on NHS.UK using a range of HTML, SASS (which is used to generate CSS) and JavaScript.

## Installation instructions

To install the prototype, please follow these instructions:

## Scenario 1

You join a high profile NHS BSA agile project that is at the Private Beta stage. The service has a prototype that doesnâ€™t use consistent, accessible patterns from the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system">NHS Design System</a>. 

Your job is to identify what elements of the prototype are off pattern, and make the relevant changes to bring them back inline.

## Scenario 2

Your new service has a simple user journey which collects a persons name, address and date of birth:

Unfortunately, for some reason, your prototype doesn't go from the address page to the date of birth page.

Your job is to debug why this might be and fix it so that it does.
