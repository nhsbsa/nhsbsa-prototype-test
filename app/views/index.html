      <h2>
        NHS.UK Prototype Kit
      </h2>

      <p>
        Within the NHS, we do a lot of prototyping of our ideas. This is to discuss ideas more clearly amongst the team and to test our ideas with real people.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Prototyping reduces risk, development and maintenance costs by testing our assumptions and ideas early and often.
      </p>

      <p>
        The NHS.UK Prototype Kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look and feel like pages on NHS.UK using a range of HTML, SASS (which is used to generate CSS) and JavaScript.

        Scenario 1
      </h2>

      <p>
        You join a high profile NHS BSA agile project that is at the Private Beta stage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your new service has a simple user journey which collects a persons name, address and date of birth and allows them to apply to be a magician:
      </p>

      <img class="app-img-guide nhsuk-u-margin-top-4 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-7" alt="Diagram of 6 pages connected together" src="/images/user-flow.svg" />

      <p>
        The prototype has a number of issues:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>It doesnâ€™t use consistent, accessible patterns from the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system">NHS Design System</a>.</li>
        <li>The prototype doesn't go from the address page to the date of birth page.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Your job is to identify what elements of the prototype are off pattern and what is stopping the prototype from working, and make the relevant changes.
