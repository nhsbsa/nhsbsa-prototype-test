      <h2>
        NHS.UK Prototype Kit
      </h2>

      <p>
        Within the NHS, we do a lot of prototyping of our ideas. This is to discuss ideas more clearly amongst the team and to test our ideas with real people.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Prototyping reduces risk, development and maintenance costs by testing our assumptions and ideas early and often.
      </p>

      <p>
        The NHS.UK Prototype Kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look and feel like pages on NHS.UK using a range of HTML, SASS (which is used to generate CSS) and JavaScript.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Scenario 1
      </h2>

      <p>
        You join a high profile NHS BSA agile project that is at the Private Beta stage. The service has a prototype that doesnâ€™t use consistent, accessible patterns from the NHS Design System.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your job is to identify what elements of the prototype are off pattern, and make the relevant changes to bring them back inline.
      </p>

      <a href="/Scenario-1" class="nhsuk-button nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-0">
        Scenario 1
      </a>

      <h2>
        Scenario 2
      </h2>

      <p>
        Your new service has a simple user journey which collects a persons name, address and date of birth:
      </p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="nhsuk-grid-row">
    <div class="nhsuk-grid-column-full">

      <img class="app-img-guide nhsuk-u-margin-top-4 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-7" alt="Diagram of 6 pages connected together" src="/images/user-flow.png" />

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="nhsuk-grid-row">
    <div class="nhsuk-grid-column-two-thirds">

      <p>
        Unfortunately, for some reason, your prototype doesn't go from the address page to the date of birth page.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Your job is to debug why this might be and fix it so that it does.
      </p>

      <a href="/Scenario-2" class="nhsuk-button nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-0">
        Scenario 2
      </a>
